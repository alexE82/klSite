                <h5>Take your productivity to the next level</h5><br>
                <p> Having the right tools for meaningful collaboration is a critical element of your success.
                    That’s why so many businesses depend on software like Microsoft SharePoint and Exchange to keep things running smoothly. But what if you could outsource all the stress this technology creates and enjoy only the benefits? With Hosted Services from TNT Solutions that’s exactly what you get.</p>
                <br><br><br>

                <h5>Hosted Microsoft SharePoint</h5><br>
                <p> Microsoft SharePoint powers up your team with Web-based access to advanced tools for project collaboration and application development. But trying to take on complex SharePoint customization in-house can leave you with a half-baked solution that is far from reaching its true potential.</p>

<p>Because your software is hosted by the experts at TNT Solutions, you’ll never have to worry about the management, maintenance or equipment that keeps them running smoothly – so you can focus on running your business.</p>
                <br><br><br>

We can modernize your business with improved security, organization, collaboration and communication. Our Microsoft Exchange hosting service is fully managed with constant uptime, so your total cost of ownership is significantly lower than managing an Exchange server in-house.</p>
